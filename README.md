### Hi there üëã I am Pengcheng Xu. 
### Welcome to visit my [Personal Website](https://explcre.github.io/).
### Welcome to talk to ChatGPT version of me on my [PengchengGPT website](https://explcre.github.io/mychat/)üòÑ! 
[ChatGPT-Chatbot-Personal-Website repo is here](https://github.com/explcre/ChatGPT-Chatbot-Personal-Website).
If you think it's cool or want to use it, please star it! Thank you~
### Welcome to play a funny battle game on [Wacky Brawlers](https://explcre.github.io/bodyfight/bodyfight_latest.html)üòÑ! 
I am welcome to any suggestions and bugs you found! Planning to make it a online multiplayer game.


Here is my warm greetings! Welcome to my home page. My name is Pengcheng Xu(pronounced as Peng-cheng Hsu).
In Chinese, my name is written as ÂæêÈπèÁ®ã, where Âæê is Xu, Èπè is Peng, Á®ã is Cheng. Âæê is my surname(Also has the meaning of slow). Èπè is a giant bird in ancient Chinese myth. It has huge wings and can fly 5000 kilometers at a time. Á®ã means journey. So, basically my name means the journey of the huge bird Èπè.This name carries the hope of my parents for me to have a bright and shining future, as well as a promising and ambitious path ahead.

- üå± Education:
    - I am going to study for Computer Sciencce PhD Degree at UC Irvine starting from 24Fall. 
    - I completed a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) by December 2023.
    - I previously obtained my Bachelor's degree in the same field ECE from the [University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn) between 2018 and 2022. 
- üé∏ In my free time, I enjoy singing, playing the guitar, working out, playing basketball, tennis, swimming, reading, watching films, and exploring everything related to science and technology. I'm particularly inspired by Richard Feynman and Elon Musk. You can check out some of my technology explanations and guitar playing on My [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/86835117/).
- üíª When it comes to programming languages, I'm skilled in C, C++, and Python. Additionally, I have project experience with MATLAB, Verilog, Java, R, and Javascript,Typescript. I also have experience using various frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sk-learn, Pandas, and Horovod.
- üî≠ My main interests are in applied machine learning for healthcare or science, computer vision, multi-modal learning, computer systems, distributed systems and distributed learning, and computer architecture.
- üî¨ Research and üíº Work Experience: 
    - I have been working on [MeiNN: Methylation embedding interpretable neural 
network to find Common functions of DNA methylation in 
phenotypes using multi-task learning](https://github.com/explcre/Adaptable-and-intrepretable-multi-task-learning-based-gene-level-methylation-estimation) since Sep,2021. I submitted a paper where I am the first author. The paper is now under review. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13866.
    - I interned as Software Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services from May 2023 to August 2023. I am working for VMware Cloud on AWS (Brio) Group. I had two projects. One is about UI rate card front-end back-end development, using Typescript,Java. One is about Anomaly Detection, using SQL,Python,Java.
    - I have been interned as a Multi-modal Cognitive Computing Algorithm Intern at [Shanghai AI Laboratory](www.shlab.org.cn). I worked on Multi-modal target detection with zero-shot depth estimation, Multi-modal Neural Architecture Search.
    - I have open-source software development experience for [OpenMLDB](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB), it's a ML related Database developed by an AI company [4Paradigm Co.,Ltd](https://en.4paradigm.com/index.html). I developed AutoFE: automated feature engineering tool. See [my pull request](https://github.com/4paradigm/OpenMLDB/pull/2381). See my [presentation for 4Paradigm in public in "OpenMLDB Meetup No.7"](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1pe4y1t7wH/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=986cc4a343d48f7717cede6222a5413a).
